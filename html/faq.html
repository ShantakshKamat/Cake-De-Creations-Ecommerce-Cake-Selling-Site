    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <div id="accordion"> 
      <h3>Can I get a cake delivered to my Margao?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          At resorts that offer Private Dining, (generally) yes. Starting in
          February 2015, all Disney World guests could have a cake delivered to
          their room from Disney Floral & Gifts. Guests could select a six-inch
          two-tiered round cake that serve 4-6 people in either chocolate or
          vanilla. Cakes could generally be delivered to your room after you
          checked-in. Cost was Rs 3000. Forks, plates, napkins, and a cake
          server are all typically included.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>When should I order my cake?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Generally, cakes should be ordered no more than 4 weeks ahead (call
          ahead of your trip to see if this has changed) and no less than 72
          hours ahead. We advise you call as soon as you can, to ensure your
          order can be processed in time for your trip.
